# hydrogen-eigenstates
Program calculating the energies of the eigenstates of hydrogen, as well as writing the specified wavefunction to a .txt file.

It does this using the B-spline method to solve a matrix eigenvalue problem. The quantum numbers n and l are hardcoded in the program.
l is called l, and n is called nn. Both are found at the start of the program.
